# Metro-Bus-Management-System

This is a 3-tier web application.

This project aims to develop a software system that automates the metro bus system making it more efficient and convenient for passengers. 
The main product features include: 

The software will allow passengers to book tickets online, eliminating the need for manual ticketing and reducing waiting times.
The system will also provide real-time information on bus routes, schedules, and available seats, allowing passengers to plan their journeys more effectively. 
Administrators will be able to manage routes, buses, and passenger data more effectively, leading to better operational efficiency and cost savings.

Implementation details:
We have two different interfaces. One for the admin and one for the passengers.
Firstly, admin logins in and is taken to the admin portal where he/she can manage buses, their schedules, view feedback and print tickets.
The passengers can signup if they dont hacve their credentials. After signing up, they login to their account.
Passengers are taken to the passenger portal where they can check seat availability, book ticket, view bus schedules and make payment.
Mysql is used as a database.
