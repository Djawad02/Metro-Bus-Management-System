# Metro-Bus-Management-System

This is a 3-tier web application.

This project aims to develop a software system that automates the metro bus system making it more efficient and convenient for passengers. 

The main product features include: 

•  The software will allow passengers to book tickets online, eliminating the need for manual ticketing and reducing waiting times.

•  The system will also provide real-time information on bus routes, schedules, and available seats, allowing passengers to plan their journeys more effectively. 

•  Administrators will be able to manage routes, buses, and passenger data more effectively, leading to better operational efficiency and cost savings.

Implementation details:

• We have two different interfaces. One for the admin and one for the passengers.

• Firstly, admin logins in and is taken to the admin portal where he/she can manage buses, their schedules, view feedback and print tickets.

• The passengers can signup if they dont hacve their credentials. After signing up, they login to their account.

• Passengers are taken to the passenger portal where they can check seat availability, book ticket, view bus schedules and make payment.

• Mysql is used as a database.
